### Project objectives:
This project focuses on progressive enhancement. The goal is to improve the usability of a student-listing directory that contains too much information. Given HTML/CSS files, write JS to add pagination and a search filter.

* Add programming to display 10 students per page, and add buttons to jump between the lists of 10 students. The solution should work for any number of student listings.
* Dynamically add a search field so that users can search through the list of students.
* Users should be able to search by name or e-mail address.
* Search results should also be paginated if there are more than 10 results.

For extra credit:
* Include simple animations when transitioning between pages.
* As the user types in the search box, dynamically filter the student listings.
* If no matches are found, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
